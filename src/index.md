				<h2>Ricky Garcia</h2>
				<p>Technical Lead & Principal Engineer</p>
				<p>It was a great pleasure working with Karl. </p>
				<p>He's not only skilled as an iOS engineer, but also a fantastic mentor, especially for our web engineers cross training on iOS and swift. His guidance was crucial as we upskilled in this new area. Not to mention his greatest contribution, bringing great energy to the team, making our work environment both fun and productive. Any team would be lucky to have him.</p>

				<h2>Kevin Ellis</h2>
				<p>Software Engineer</p>
				<p>Our loss is YOUR gain!</p>
				<p>Karl is one of the most thoughtful and kind people I’ve ever met. He has an incredible knack for making sure that every single member of our team felt respected, honored, and listened to. He is unashamedly positive and adds HUGE value to any team he is on.</p>
				<p>I wholeheartedly recommend him for any software position. He’s writing his own programming language for goodness sake. He is proficient in architecture, design, mobile development, and seriously? I can’t get over how POSITIVE he is. Nothing holds this man back from brightening a room.</p>
