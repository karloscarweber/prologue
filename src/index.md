		<h4>Gather:</h4>
		<p class="paragraph withered">Look around, find what fits, investigate, research and collect everything that's pertinent. We hold meetings when we need to, and discover everything possible.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Experiment:</h4>
		<p class="paragraph withered">Take what We've found and make some tests and figure out how things will work. Will this design direction work? does it make sense? Try it out a bit. Will this be good? Ok... make a plan to execute and deliver. Try some random stuff from our research. The important thing is that this is <strong>the decision point</strong>. Our Experiments determine our Plan.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Draft âˆž:</h4>
		<p class="paragraph withered">Whether it's code or design, build a first complete draft, then take a step back and ask for feedback. Keep drafting and receiving feedback until we have something that works, That we like, Or we run out of time.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Deliver:</h4>
		<p class="paragraph withered">Now that our thing is complete, we send it off. We button it up and deliver it. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Tick Tock</h3>
		<p class="paragraph withered">We alternate our work cycles between Building and Refactoring/Fixing. The longer we have with a project the more context there is for us to make the right decisions. We need to have the opportunity to continually improve the project to keep it's momentum going.</p>
