	<p class="paragraph measure ta-justify">Now I only sell montly retainers, and I cut my time up into 40 hour slots. Buy one slot and you have my focus for 1 week per month. I can get a LOT done in a single focused week. </p>

	<blockquote class="quote measure ta-center">"On Netflix I can watch as many movies<br> as I'd like?"</blockquote>

	<p class="paragraph measure ta-justify">Yes, this is true, but how often have you been browsing Netflix and thought it's all sort of meh. There's nothing to watch. Prologue is like that, but just the good stuff. We're great at not just building things that last and can scale, but also building only the stuff we need to build.</p>
