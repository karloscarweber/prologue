### Ruby Camping

Ever since our love affair with Ruby began We've been working on Ruby Camping. A ruby micro-web framework full of gags. First resurrected in 2022 after almost a decade in the garage, Camping now works and gets better every day.

We're prepping the newest release, 3.0, that includes support for the Sequel Gem, Rack 3, componentized plugins called gear, and more.

The Ruby ecosystem is vibrant beyond just rails and we are happy to contribute.

### Meow Meow Japan

A small Kawaii Store in Utah, we build everything they put online. Website, iOS app, and social media integrations.

We fucking love it.

### Punk

Yeah so RSS kicks ass. The segmentation of the web was a MISTAKE, and is considered by many as a bad idea.

Punk is an RSS Reader with some light social features. Subscribe to Blogs, Mastodon accounts,  Podcast feeds, all that shit. Punk doesn't give a fuck, It will just do it.

### Cheddar

Another neglected Classic we're bringing back. Cheddar is a simple to-do list that's instantly in sync across all your devices. That's pretty standard stuff nowadays but it used to be cutting edge.

We brought Cheddar back online, and into the modern web by upgrading the whole shebang to the latest versions of Ruby and Rails. Our Future plans are to overhaul the design, and apps to be badass once more.
